			<h2>Purpose</h2>

				<p>The purpose of this website is to inform the public about the Art Fight event held once a month at Tractor Brewing Co. Wells Park.  It is a live art competition where the beer drinking public decide the winner.  Each artist creates a work of art from scratch during the three hour event based on a theme.  During that time every drink purchased comes with a free ticket that patrons use to vote for their favorite artist of the night. At the end of the event we count the votes and declare a winner.  The action isn't over though until we auction off the artwork that was made that night. The proceeds are split between the artist and some sort of cause. Past Art Fights have helped the Muertos y Marigolds Parade, PACA, Babe's and Bullies, the Bees and Seeds Festival, Southwest Organizing Project and many more. Art Fight has been going strong for two years and continues to grow. The website will aim to sign people up for a mailing list to keep them informed of events and pertinent information.</p>
