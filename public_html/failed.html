			<p>Hong Kong Phooey, number one super guy. Hong Kong Phooey, quicker than the human eye. He's got style, a groovy style, and a car that just won't stop. When the going gets tough, he's really rough, with a Hong Kong Phooey chop (Hi-Ya!). Hong Kong Phooey, number one super guy. Hong Kong Phooey, quicker than the human eye. Hong Kong Phooey, he's fan-riffic!</p>

			<p>Thank you zombie boyfriends. Dr. Yap, once I was into you, but after seeing you torture my father, I think we should just be friends with dental benefits. I know how the shark thinks. It's confused. It doesn't know why we want to kill it. It just wants to go home. Argh!... Wait, I like the library. There's a lot of carrots in that stew. Hey Jimmy Jr. Did you see those two squirrels fighting in the courtyard? A pants-off. For me? Our toaster is also confused. It doesn't know where bagels go. I'm not spooked. What's the next thing after spooked? I'm that. I've logged over 3,000 fantasy hours on my relationship with Jimmy Jr. You don't just throw that away. Dad, I need you to drop everything and shave my legs. Time for the charm bomb to explode. You're right. I'm a firestarter and a jinx. I'm going to destroy this whole family. Suddenly, Tina Belcher appeared in the doorway. She knew what she had to do. Drop the towel. Dear Diary: Tonight I'm sneaking off to the abandoned taffy factory to look for treasure. Also, if boys had uteruses, they'd be called duderuses. My hearttttttttt. I need both ears to hold up my glasses. </p>

			<p>Dear God, this is Tina from school. Just when I think I'm out, those cheeks pull me right back in. Thank you zombie boyfriends. Dad, you're the best pimp a girl could ever have. Jimmy Jr. had a chance to ride the Tina truck, but now it's headed straight for Joshville. Toot-toot. The hand wants what the hand wants. I want a dry erase board so I can write down all my private thoughts and then erase them immediately. I need to find a boy with a turtle bite on his finger. </p>

		<!--Start of Section 6-->

		<section id="section6">

			<p>DYou won't regret it, dad. When I kiss Jimmy Jr. under the disco ball, it'll be like we're all kissing Jimmy Jr under the disco ball. Dear Diary: Tonight I'm sneaking off to the abandoned taffy factory to look for treasure. Also, if boys had uteruses, they'd be called duderuses. I had no idea there was so much butt touching in baseball. I'm not spooked. What's the next thing after spooked? I'm that. I'm no hero. I just put my bra on one boob at a time. Drop the towel. Dad, you're the best pimp a girl could ever have. She grabbed Jimmy Jr's butt and changed the world.</p>
