My pwp for Art Fight

## Milestone 1 Feedback
Great work here James. Your directory structure is perfect, and your HTML looks great. There are only a few minor edits and suggestions I have regarding your code. See Edits &amp; Suggestions below.

Your persona, use case, purpose, audience and goal are all very well done and clearly defined here - great job! This provides you with a solid direction with which you can move forward designing your site. Because your users will be looking for a fair amount of important information about Art Fight, your content layout choices are going to need some careful consideration. Pay close attention to the placement and hierarchy of your content in your layout. For example, should Upcoming Event dates have more visual weight or higher placement than the Rules, or vice versa? 

Also, if sections of your content are large and a one-page layout begins to feel "cluttered", I would consider multiple pages. I can see the potential for a project like yours being more effective as a multi-page site if your content becomes long. If you feel this way, talk to us **ASAP**. Multi-page PWPs will need to be built using a slightly different methodology than one-page sites, so we will need to sort this out before you begin development. 

Also, you mention an email sign-up list. Do you have a managed email list for Art Fight set up (like on MailChimp)? I can see a use case for two different forms on your site: the regular contact form, AND an email signup form. Usually mailing list services will provide you with ready-made code snippets, so the email subscription form should not be a problem if you use a mailing list manager. 

All in all - great work. I'm looking forward to seeing this project take shape. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin work on Milestone 2&alpha;

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Delete `index.html` from the `/documentation` directory.
- Watch your HTML indentation (see lines 32, 42, 53, etc.)
- Instead of the &lt;b&gt; tag to create bolded text, use the &lt;strong&gt; tag instead. This is the current HTML5 standard.
- Don't forget the `lang='en'` attribute on your &lt;html&gt; tag.
